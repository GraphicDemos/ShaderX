This demo renders volumetric clouds using a 3D fBm fractal, and implict surfaces, which are blended together. The cloud density is set using a turbulence function. The clouds are rendering by drawing slices though the 3D texture containing the noise used to create the fBm fractal. The Pixel Shader is applied to the slices to create the clouds. The 3D texture is a 64x64x64 noise texture. The texture only needs to be generated once. In the demo, there are two implict surfaces of different sizes, the settings of which can be modified by changing the provided parameters. The rest of the 3D texture could be used to store the gradient of the noise function for use in lighting.
