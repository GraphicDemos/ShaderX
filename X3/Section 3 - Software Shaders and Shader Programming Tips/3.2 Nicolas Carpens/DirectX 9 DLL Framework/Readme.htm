<P>This demo performs stencil shadowing in software.</P>
<P>Use the mouse and cursor keys to manoeuvre around. Press 'B' to see the shadow 
	volume. Several settings can be changed in the swShader.ini file as well.
</P>
<P>Enjoy!</P>

<P><U>TECHNOLOGY</U></P>
<P>The software rendering core is the swShader library (sw-shader.sf.net). It uses 
	run-time assembly compilation and optimization to obtain superiour software 
	rendering performance and flexibility. It features support for even the newest 
	DirectX shaders. Every frame a shadow volume is constructed from the model's 
	silhouette. It is rendered to the stencil buffer using the depth-pass 
	technique. The part not in shadow is diffusely lit while the shadowed part uses 
	ambient lighting in a second pass. Because of the knot's geometry , the 
	overdraw in the stencil buffer can be up to eight, which partially explains the 
	low performance of this demo. A hack in the diffuse lighting is used to 
	minimize shadow popping. There are no special optimizations to speed up 
	stenciling, like the ones mentioned in the ShaderX<sup>3</sup> book.</P>
