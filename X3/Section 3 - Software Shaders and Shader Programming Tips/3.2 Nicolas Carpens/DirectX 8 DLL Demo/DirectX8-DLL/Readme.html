		<P>These demos show the software rendering capabilities of <A href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">
				swShader</A> as a <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/">DirectX</A> 8 
			DLL. When the d3d8.dll is placed next to an executable that uses <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/">
				DirectX</A> 8, all calls will be intercepted. Because <A href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">
				swShader</A> renders everything on the CPU, no 3D hardware acceleration is 
			required.</P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
		<P>This is an alpha version. Please check <A href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net</A>
			&nbsp;regularly for newer versions.</P>
		<P>Because this is an alpha version, it is potentially unstable. Many features are 
			not supported (see below) and features that are expected to work might still 
			fail. Although this software has little potential of damaging your system, and 
			certainly hasn't been designed that way, I make no warranty that it doesn't so. 
			Use it at your own discretion. Please read the detailed <A href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</A>
			at the bottom.</P>

		<P>The demo executables are&nbsp;produced from the freely available <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b75955d0-52af-4bdf-8aa9-7c3ebd798bf6&amp;DisplayLang=en">
				DirectX 8 SDK</A>&nbsp;using the unmodified code. You can test hardware 
			accelerated rendering by renaming or removing the d3d8.dll from this 
			package&nbsp;folder.</P>
		<P>They require Windows 98/XP and a Pentium II compatible processor. A Pentium III 
			compatible processor is highly recommended for&nbsp;<A href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">
				swShader</A>'s vector operations. Pentium II and Athlon - 
			Thunderbird&nbsp;processors will use an emulation mode which is much 
			slower.&nbsp;Your graphics card should be DirectDraw 7 compatible and support 
			32-bit color. Your desktop color depth should be 32-bit.&nbsp;No 3D hardware 
			acceleration required! If you meet these specifications and the demos don't 
			work, please contact me at <A href="mailto:nicolas@capens.net">nicolas@capens.net</A>.</P>

		<P dir="ltr">You are free to use the DLL&nbsp;of this package&nbsp;<U>for 
				non-commercial purposes</U>. Bug reports or any other feedback are very 
			much appreciated. Below is a list of features that should already be supported, 
			and some notes about stability.</P>
		<P dir="ltr">General architecture: swShader's&nbsp;fixed-function pixel pipeline 
			consists of up to eight stages, and each stage can do a texture lookup. All <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/">
				DirectX</A> arguments and nearly all blending operations are supported. 
			However, there is no separate pipeline for the alpha channel. It supports all 
			stencil operations, all depth compare modes and some limited alpha blending. 
			The fixed-function vertex pipeline implements basic T&amp;L but no fog or 
			texture coordinate transformations. Six user-defined clipping planes can be 
			set.</P>
		<P dir="ltr">DLL interfaces:</P>
		<UL dir="ltr">
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3D8 nearly fully implemented. Supports only one adapter. GetDeviceCaps 
					can be inaccurate. GetAdapterMonitor unimplemented. GetAdapterIdentifier 
					returns no useful information.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DBaseTexture8 fully implemented. No LOD or priority control. PreLoad 
					has no effect.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DCubeTexture8 not supported.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DDevice8 implements most important functions.&nbsp;State blocks, swap 
					chains, pixel shaders, programmable vertex shaders, DrawPrimitiveUP 
					and&nbsp;gamma ramp entirely unsupported. Nearly all state changes advertised 
					in GetDeviceCaps are supported.&nbsp;No fog.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DIndexBuffer8 fully implemented.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DSurface8 fully implemented.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DSwapChain8 not supported.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DTexture8 fully implemented. Same remarks as IDirect3DBaseTexture8.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DVertexBuffer8 fully implemented. Blend weights and point size not 
					supported.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DVolume8 not supported.</DIV>
			<LI>
				<DIV>IDirect3DVolumeTexture8 not supported.</DIV>
			</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>"Fully implemented" only means that all the interface's functions have an 
			implementation. It doesn't mean this implementation is entirely tested.</P>
		<P>There are known issues with the state management system. <A href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">
				swShader</A> caches render operations and associates a state. However, this 
			state is not a one-to-one mapping with the DirectX states and currently it is 
			not flawless. Therefore, it is possible that one render operation does not 
			behave the same every time or cause an error even when the exact same DirectX 
			state is used. This will be fixed in the near future.</P>

		<P><A href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">swShader</A> uses run-time code 
			generation and SIMD assembly to achieve superiour software rendering 
			performance and flexibility. By eliminating the need for state checks in the 
			rendering pipeline, the full processor power is available. New rendering 
			functions are generated when needed, and cached for reuse.</P>
		<P>The run-time code generation is powered by&nbsp;<A href="http://softwire.sourceforge.net">SoftWire</A>.&nbsp;It 
			features <A href="http://softwire.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html">run-time 
				intrinsics</A>, which allows to conveniently&nbsp;convert any shader 
			instruction as an x86 assembly block. It is possible to do register allocation 
			and peephole optimizations without multiple passes. The produced code is 
			comparable to hand-optimized code.</P>
