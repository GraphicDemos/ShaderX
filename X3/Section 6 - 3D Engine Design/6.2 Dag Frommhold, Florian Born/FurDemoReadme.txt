This sample shows a simple shell based fur effect performed with the Trinigy
Vision Engine. A vertex program extrudes the shells along the normals and
applies anisotropic lighting. The nummer of fur shells is reduced according
to screen space layer distance. The triangle count of the wolf model thus
varies between 5,500 (very far away) and 28,000 (closeup) triangles.
