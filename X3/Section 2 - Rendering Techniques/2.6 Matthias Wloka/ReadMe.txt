
There are two projects: The AtlasCreationTool and the AtlasComparisonViewer.

Both have Docs/ subdirectories that contain UserGuides.

These projects contain and were built under the DirectX9c (Summer 2004) SDK, RC0, version 1247.
In case the AtlasComparisonViewer displays the error message "Incorrect DX Version" you 
have to upgrade to the latest version of the DirectX SDK and recompile your DX9 libraries
and substitute the enclosed DXUT.lib.

You should also run the AtlasComparisonViewer from the 
BatchingViaAtlases\DEMOS\Direct3D9\src\BatchingViaTextureAtlases\AtlasComparisonViewer
directory.

Finally, feel free to check for the latest version of this software at:
