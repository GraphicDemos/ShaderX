<H2>Shaderey</H2>
A Beyond3D/ATi DX9 shader competition entry (2003 Sep, some additional tweaks for ShaderX3 during 2004 May); history<br>
General readme here: <A href="readme.html">readme.html</A>.

<h3>Why such demo?</h3>

<p>
The basic ideas that can come up when writing a "shader demo":
	<ol>
	<li>Good materials (BRDFs, etc.)<br>
		<i>everyone's already doing this :)</i>
	<li>Good light transport (shadows, soft shadows, radiance transfer, etc.)<br>
		<i>ditto, though PRT-like something would be interesting</i>
	<li>Funky things (non photorealistic, distorted renderings, etc.)
	<li>Creative ways of using hardware (raytracing, matrix solvers, etc.)<br>
		<i>usually requires lots of maths skills, plus really lots of creativity :(</i>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
Now, I chose 3rd option, that is, some non-realistic rendering.
</p>
<p>
Since the time of "Bzhykt" intro I was wondering whether it's possible to render the same entirely in hardware. "Bzhykt" intro is
<A href="http://www.gim.ktu.lt/nesnausk/nearaz/projBzhykt.html">here</A> <i>(hey! don't run it! it doesn't work, crashes, and is a complete crap!)</i>.
So, I set off for terrain, trees etc., with edges/hatches on it, and some "painterly" style. It's possible to achieve exactly the same look -- requires lots of rendertarget
changes (similar to building a summed area table). But, alas, it didn't look good at all -- possibly due to some bugs on my part, possibly because of lack of precision
or some other thing.
</p>
<p>
All in all, the final result is this.
